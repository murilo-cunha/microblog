The prompt of the week is "name three things you are grateful for today". Not that hard of a question, but an important one. In fact, every day before going to bed me and my spouse share 3 gratitudes we had in the day.

In this moment, I'm grateful for my health. I'm grateful for all the possibilities I have in my life. I'm grateful for starting these journaling habits (including these texts). I'm grateful for my spouse. For friends. For financial health. So many things really. And sometimes, especially on hard days, I forget. The days when it matters the most.

What are you grateful for?

My wife just came and said: "I didn't know you were starting your blog today."

"Me neither."

It's easy to go through the motions. Sometimes I think I'm too tired or busy or distracted but I'm really just going through with the motions. And sometimes we just need to start. And it comes.

Even if it doesn't, you're already better off doing a bit rather than not doing at all.

So just start.

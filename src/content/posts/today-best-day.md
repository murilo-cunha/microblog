I was gifted journaling cards. The first one reads: "How can you make today the best day?".

It's a good question. I feel like my best days are the ones that I find balance: meditation, sports, fun, connecting with loved ones. Something for the mind, body and soul. But maybe that's too much for one day. Maybe it's not possible to do all that in a day. Life also fluctuates, and maybe we should also compensate harder days with more recovery. And we also need the lower days. It's like a roller coaster. Or a good book. The ups and downs are the essence of excitement. A book that has no challenges to overcome is not a good book.

So does that mean that a good life is a life of balance? Just repeating this recipe for the most amount of days amounts to a good life? I'm not sure. I think you can "feel good" but not fulfilled. I think a truly good life should go beyond "feel good": it must also be fulfilling. Should bring purpose. Amount to something. So yes, balanced days result in good days, and good days result in good life, but for the best life we should also look at something that pulls you forward, something that you're excited to go towards. Call it hobbies, side gigs, whatever. Can be family. Can be connecting with others. Can be a passion project. And it can change over time too.

A good life is an intentional one. One that you choose something to chase and chase it. Whether you want to become rich, or hoard goats. If you do what you set yourself to do, then I'll call you successful. And hope you have the best days.
